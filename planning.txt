CodeBridge - Assignment 1 Planning

Project Partner: Working alone

Vision for the site:
- Wanted to create something that felt relevant to computer science students at MRU.
- Decided to build a fictional peer tutoring service that connects students with other students.
- Kept the name simple and clean: CodeBridge (because it bridges the gap between confusion and clarity).
- Aimed for a modern, minimalistic, and tech-inspired look.

Page breakdown:
- index.html – clean landing page with an intro to what CodeBridge is and why it exists.
- services.html – a table showing what subjects are offered, who the tutor is, and when they’re available.
- contact.html – a working contact form where users can submit questions or session requests.

Design decisions:
- Color scheme is blue/white/gray to keep it neutral, academic, and clean.
- Added a splash screen with the logo to give it some life on load.
- Navigation is simple and centered so it’s consistent across all pages.
- Used a full-width background image on the home page to add visual interest without distracting.
- External and internal links added as required.
- Used <figure> and <figcaption> as well as form validation and meta tags on all pages.

Tools used:
- VS Code
- GitHub (for commits and version history)
- Formspree for real email functionality on the contact page
